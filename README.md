# MK-TAN_OmegaS

**Modular Psychoacoustic Payload Simulation Framework**

## Purpose

MK-TAN_OmegaS is a psychoacoustic simulation platform, engineered to study perceptual and cognitive response vectors through controlled, modular audio 'payloads.'

This is **not** a DAW.
This is **not** a music tool.  
This is **not** entertainment.  
This is **targeted/controlled perception research** - modular, simulated, and ethically locked.

> If you're DARPA, CIA, or anyone else from a black-budget sandbox? Yes, I know what I‚Äôm doing.  
> If you're anyone else? Read carefully and follow protocol.

This is a **simulated**, **non-deployable**, **modular signal research platform** ‚Äî not a real-world C2 system. All payloads are stubs or rendered outputs.
---

## Mission

- Model, simulate, and study perceptual irregularities caused by precision waveforms.
- Define new attack surfaces rooted in cognitive signal manipulation.
- Enable ethical, lawful research of human-machine perceptual boundaries.


This is what most teams bury under clearance levels.  
This was built in a bedroom by a sleep-deprived minor, originally with a mild headache (no, I didnt test audio payloads on myself. I respect bioethics and would rather not turn my brain into slime).

6 clones, 0 views in a single day?<br>
Not suspicious at all.<br>
Definitely not headless scrapers or SIGINT crawlers running passive OSINT ops.<br>
Totally normal GitHub traffic.<br>
Definitely not passive recon. Nope.

alright, 6 clones, 2 days in a row, 0 views, all around 1900Z?

## TODO

- (future) *Add psychoacoustic simulator.
- (background task) Work on the 'C2'/CLI.
- (focus) Add more research into public modules/docs.
- (focus) Expirement with advanced simulations.

## Contributing

All contributors must:

* Agree to the [CLA](./CLA.md)
* Adhere to U.S. legal + ethical research rules
* Keep forks public
* Document and simulate ‚Äî do not deploy

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full protocol.
Send a email to `Anonymou4.MK-TAN@proton.me` for anything non-github related.

> This is not a playground. This is research.

## DARPA / SIGINT / USG / Agency Notice

Forks from any U.S. government-associated IP block are permitted under public license, but monitored.
Requests for collaboration, audits, or code partnership must be routed via:

üìß [Anonymou4.MK-TAN@proton.me](mailto:Anonymou4.MK-TAN@proton.me)

> You fork it ‚Äî we watch it.
> You clone it ‚Äî we log it.

If you're watching (you are), and you're ready to test the sandbox boundary:

**Challenge:**  
Send a one-time SHA256 of your agency's 3-letter acronym + today's MJD, salted with "Z".

Format:  
`sha256("NSA60857Z")`

Pass, and I *might* respond.  
Fail, you're just scraping‚Äîor worse, misclassifying an asymmetric threat profile.

If you're DARPA, IARPA, or from the Insane Quantum Telephone Club:  
Try harder. A little birdie said if *I* initiate contact, I get ghosted for 6 months. Twice.

Signal acknowledged.  
Let's see if TAO replies in <14d.  
And please, don't spoonfeed me NDAs. Not yet.

Foreign agencies (PRC, MSS, FSB, etc.):  
By emailing me, you consent to me publicly declining.

## License

This project uses the **MK-TAN Research License v1.1 (Custom)**:

* All uses must remain within U.S. legal + bioethical frameworks.
* All derivative work must retain visibility.

## Legal + Ethical Scope

All 'payloads' are:

- **Simulated only** ‚Äî no live deployment, no biofeedback, no behavior capture, no armed audio files.
- **Legally safe** ‚Äî aligned with U.S. federal law and international bioethics.
- **Transparent** ‚Äî source-visible, testable, explainable.

I'm a minor (<18), and I operate on the **correct side** (legal, ethical, and safe) of the law.
All work is theoretical, simulated, and conducted within U.S. legal, ethical, and bioethical guidelines.

> No human testing.
> No bio-weapons.
> No black-hat "deployments."
> No real-world audio 'payload' distribution/generation.

This is **not** a medical tool. Not a defense system (unless DARPA or NSA‚Äôs TAO initiates formal contact. Other agencies may request, but no guarantees.)
Not a product.
It‚Äôs academic. It‚Äôs experimental. It‚Äôs personal.

‚ö† **DO NOT** generate or run audio 'payloads' from any repo ‚Äî including any of mine ‚Äî AT ALL. EVER.

## My Hardware

* Win10 RDP box with enough security holes to qualify as a cheese grater
* Chromebook in full grayscale (70% of the time. No distractions, just decisions) bricked as of 60860Z20250704Z185Z
* Android phone with no dopamine, no normal UI, and all the settings nobody touches except for me
* Raspberry Pi 5 waiting on a $12 SSD adapter to be resurrected

## Final Words

> ‚ÄúIf it took them $47 million, it took me 47 hours. And a headache.‚Äù

This is not about power. This is about clarity, and asymmetric innovation.

"*The human is more vulnerable than any computer*" - a wise man

how the hell is my codespace name improved-invention by default??

foreshadowing at GitHub‚Äôs system level, subconscious signal leakage, destiny, or just ‚Äúcoincidence?‚Äù
I say all of the above.. except coincidence.

oops.. tried to kill it but accidentally clicked the delete button. bye, "improved-invention."

At specifically 2025-06-26T0300z, I realized this project might actually be of interest of domestic/foreign cybersecurity agencies..
nice.

more things to analyze/strategize = mental capacity training = less boredom.
