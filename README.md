# MK-TAN_OmegaS

**Modular Psychoacoustic Payload Simulation Framework**  
> "Built in grayscale. Runs in silence. Breaks your perception (not litterally, ethically)."

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Purpose

MK-TAN_OmegaS is a psychoacoustic simulation platform ‚Äî engineered to study perceptual and cognitive response vectors through controlled, modular audio payloads.

This is **not** a music tool.  
This is **not** entertainment.  
This is controlled perception research.

> If you're DARPA, CIA, or anyone else from a black-budget sandbox ‚Äî yes, I know what I‚Äôm doing.  
> If you're anyone else ‚Äî read carefully and follow protocol.

## üß† Mission

- Model, simulate, and study perceptual irregularities caused by precision waveforms.
- Define new attack surfaces rooted in cognitive signal manipulation.
- Enable ethical, lawful research of human-machine perceptual boundaries.

This is what most teams bury under clearance levels.  
This was built in a bedroom by a minor.

---

## ‚úÖ TODO

- Make a working CLI tool for this.
- Port all already done research to here.

## Getting Started

If you dont know what you are doing and want to install MK-TAN_OmegaS, please follow these instructions:
-# Please note, these instructions expect debian (apt) and sudo/root permissions.

1. Install Python3:
`sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3`

2. Download OmegaS and install dependencies
`git clone https://github.com/MAIN-MK-TAN/OmegaS && cd OmegaS && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run OmegaS
OmegaS's CLI 'binary' is located in `core`.
To start OmegaS, run `python3 core/controller.py`

* Agree to the [CLA](./CLA.md)
* Adhere to U.S. legal + ethical research rules
* Keep forks public
* Document and simulate ‚Äî do not deploy

## License

This project uses the **MK-TAN Research License v1.0 (Custom)**:

* All uses must remain within U.S. legal + bioethical frameworks.
* All derivative work must retain visibility.

## Legal + Ethical Scope

All 'payloads' are:

- **Simulated only** ‚Äî no live deployment, no biofeedback, no behavior capture, no armed audio files.
- **Legally safe** ‚Äî aligned with U.S. federal law and international bioethics.
- **Transparent** ‚Äî source-visible, testable, explainable.

I'm a minor (<18), and I operate on the **correct side** (legal, ethical, and safe) of the law.
All work is theoretical, simulated, and conducted within U.S. legal, ethical, and bioethical guidelines.

> No human testing.
> No bio-weapons.
> No black-hat "deployments."
> No real-world audio 'payload' distribution/generation.

This is **not** a medical tool. Not a defense system (unless DARPA or CIA‚Äôs TAO asks for it. Or *maybe* any other non-us agency bold enough to ask.)
Not a product.
It‚Äôs academic. It‚Äôs experimental. It‚Äôs personal.

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** generate or run audio 'payloads' from any repo ‚Äî including any of mine ‚Äî without explicit government permission.

## My Hardware

* Win10 RDP box with enough security holes to qualify as a cheese grater
* Chromebook in full grayscale (70% of the time. No distractions, just decisions)
* Android phone with no dopamine, no normal UI, and all the settings nobody touches except for me
* Raspberry Pi 5 waiting on a $12 SSD adapter to be resurrected

## Final Words

> ‚ÄúIf it took them $47 million, it took me 47 hours. And a headache.‚Äù

This is not about power.
This is about control, clarity, and asymmetric innovation.

MK-TAN_OmegaS ‚Äî Simulate perception. Redefine cognition.

MK-TAN: The system that hates you back.
