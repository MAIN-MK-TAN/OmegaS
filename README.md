# MK-TAN_OmegaS

**Modular Psychoacoustic Payload Simulation Framework**  
> "Built in grayscale. Runs in silence. Breaks your perception (not litterally)."

---

## ⚠️ Purpose

MK-TAN_OmegaS is a psychoacoustic simulation platform — engineered to study perceptual and cognitive response vectors through controlled, modular audio payloads.

This is **not** a music tool.  
This is **not** entertainment.  
This is controlled perception research.

> If you're DARPA, CIA, or anyone else from a black-budget sandbox — yes, I know what I’m doing.  
> If you're anyone else — read carefully and follow protocol.

## 🧠 Mission

- Model, simulate, and study perceptual irregularities caused by precision waveforms.
- Define new attack surfaces rooted in cognitive signal manipulation.
- Enable ethical, lawful research of human-machine perceptual boundaries.

This is what most teams bury under clearance levels.  
This was built in a bedroom by a minor.

## 🧪 Legal + Ethical Scope

All payloads are:

- **Simulated only** — no live deployment, no biofeedback, no behavior capture.
- **Legally safe** — aligned with U.S. federal law and international bioethics.
- **Transparent** — source-visible, testable, explainable.

🚫 No active devices.  
🚫 No human targeting.  
🚫 No use outside secured, private simulations.

## 🧾 Final Words

> “If it took them \$47 million, it took me 47 hours.”

This is not about power.
This is about control, clarity, and asymmetric innovation.

MK-TAN\_OmegaS — Simulate perception. Redefine cognition.

MK-TAN - The system that hates you back.
