# MK-TAN_OmegaS

**Modular Psychoacoustic Payload Simulation Framework**  
> "Built in grayscale. Runs in silence. Breaks your perception (not literally, ethically)."

---

## Purpose

MK-TAN_OmegaS is a psychoacoustic simulation platform, engineered to study perceptual and cognitive response vectors through controlled, modular audio 'payloads.'

This is **not** a DAW.
This is **not** a music tool.  
This is **not** entertainment.  
This is **targeted/controlled perception research** - modular, simulated, and ethically locked.

> If you're DARPA, CIA, or anyone else from a black-budget sandbox? Yes, I know what I’m doing.  
> If you're anyone else? Read carefully and follow protocol.

This is a **simulated**, **non-deployable**, **modular signal research platform** — not a real-world C2 system. All payloads are stubs or rendered outputs.
---

## Mission

- Model, simulate, and study perceptual irregularities caused by precision waveforms.
- Define new attack surfaces rooted in cognitive signal manipulation.
- Enable ethical, lawful research of human-machine perceptual boundaries.


This is what most teams bury under clearance levels.  
This was built in a bedroom by a sleep-deprived minor, originally with a mild headache (no, I didnt test audio payloads on myself. I respect bioethics and would rather not turn my brain into slime).

## TODO

- Add more research into public modules/docs
- *Add psychoacoustic simulations.

git clone https://github.com/MAIN-MK-TAN/OmegaS && cd OmegaS  
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  
python3 core/controller.py
```

## Legal + Ethical Scope

All 'payloads' are:

- **Simulated only** — no live deployment, no biofeedback, no behavior capture, no armed audio files.
- **Legally safe** — aligned with U.S. federal law and international bioethics.
- **Transparent** — source-visible, testable, explainable.

I'm a minor (<18), and I operate on the **correct side** (legal, ethical, and safe) of the law.
All work is theoretical, simulated, and conducted within U.S. legal, ethical, and bioethical guidelines.

> No human testing.
> No bio-weapons.
> No black-hat "deployments."
> No real-world audio 'payload' distribution/generation.

This is **not** a medical tool. Not a defense system (unless DARPA or CIA’s TAO asks for it. Or *maybe* any other non-us agency bold enough to ask.)
Not a product.
It’s academic. It’s experimental. It’s personal.

⚠ **DO NOT** generate or run audio 'payloads' from any repo — including any of mine — without explicit government permission.

## My Hardware

* Win10 RDP box with enough security holes to qualify as a cheese grater
* Chromebook in full grayscale (70% of the time. No distractions, just decisions)
* Android phone with no dopamine, no normal UI, and all the settings nobody touches except for me
* Raspberry Pi 5 waiting on a $12 SSD adapter to be resurrected

## Final Words

> “If it took them $47 million, it took me 47 hours. And a headache.”

This is not about power.
This is about clarity, and asymmetric innovation.

At specifically 2025-06-26T0300z, I realized this project might actually be of interest of domestic/foreign cybersecurity agencies..
nice.

more things to analyze/strategize = mental capacity training = less boredom.
