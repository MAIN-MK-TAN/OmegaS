Contributing to MK-TAN_OmegaS

Welcome to MK-TAN_OmegaS, a modular framework for exploring cognitive response surfaces through precision psychoacoustic payload simulation.

This project is not entertainment. It's not for dopamine. It is engineered for clarity, disruption, and edge-case behavioral study ‚Äî within U.S. legal and bioethical guidelines.

If you're here to help shape the most unconventional cognitive payload research project on GitHub, read this carefully.

üß† Core Principles

Legality First ‚Äî All contributions must align with U.S. federal law and international bioethics frameworks.

Transparency Required ‚Äî No black-box submissions, encrypted blobs, or untraceable binaries.

High-Discipline Only ‚Äî This is not a toy. Submissions must be minimal, well-structured, and well-documented.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

1. Fork the Project

Fork this repo and clone your fork locally.

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MK-TAN_OmegaS.git

2. Follow Project Structure

Stick to the modular architecture:

/core/ ‚Äì internal framework logic

/payloads/ ‚Äì defined psychoacoustic or signal manipulation modules

/cli/ ‚Äì command-line interface logic

/docs/ ‚Äì documentation, specs, and theory

/sim/ ‚Äì simulation or logging tools

etc.


Do not mix concerns across modules.

3. Sign the CLA

You must read and agree to the CLA before submitting.

By doing so, you agree to:

Keep forks public and open-source

Follow U.S. legal and bioethical standards

Accept monitoring, audit, and documentation requests by the Maintainer

Comply with takedown requests if your fork or contribution violates the project‚Äôs ethical or operational boundaries


4. Add Documentation

Each module or payload must include:

A concise Markdown doc in /docs/ explaining purpose, parameters, and behavior

A simulated output .log, diagram, or screenshot (if applicable)


5. Make a Pull Request

Push your changes and open a PR.

Include:

A clear summary of what was changed or added

Any references to related issues

Whether the contribution is experimental or stable

‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Submit

Audio files with active or testable payloads

Binary-only contributions

Obfuscated, encrypted, or AI-generated blobs

Anything you wouldn't confidently defend in a courtroom or audit



---

üß™ Research-Only, Legally Safe

All contributions must simulate or log only ‚Äî no active deployment.

Payloads must never target real individuals, environments, or hardware.
This is for controlled analysis and defensive cognition study, not deployment or manipulation.


---

üõ∞Ô∏è Government + Research Partners

If you're from DARPA, CIA, MITRE, IARPA, or another agency:

We're open to collaboration. However:

All forks must remain visible and auditable

Attribution is required

Code changes and use cases must be clearly disclosed


You fork it ‚Äî we observe it.


---

üßæ Final Notes

Respect the mission: cognitive weaponization without compromise.

We simulate for clarity, not confusion.

We build for analysis, not harm.


Let‚Äôs redefine the boundaries of digital perception ‚Äî together.
