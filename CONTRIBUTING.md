# Contributing to MK-TAN_OmegaS

Welcome to **MK-TAN_OmegaS**, a modular framework for exploring cognitive response surfaces through precision psychoacoustic payload simulation.

This project is not entertainment. It's not for dopamine. It is engineered for clarity, disruption, and edge-case behavioral study ‚Äî within U.S. legal and bioethical guidelines.

If you're here to help shape the most unconventional cognitive payload research project on GitHub, read this carefully.

## üß† Core Principles

- **Legality First** ‚Äî All contributions must align with U.S. federal law and international bioethics frameworks.  
- **Transparency Required** ‚Äî No black-box submissions, encrypted blobs, or untraceable binaries.  
- **High-Discipline Only** ‚Äî This is not a toy. Submissions must be minimal, well-structured, and well-documented.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Project
Fork this repo and clone your fork locally.

```git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MK-TAN_OmegaS.git```

### 2. Follow Project Structure

Stick to the modular architecture:

* `/core/` ‚Äì internal framework logic
* `/payloads/` ‚Äì defined psychoacoustic or signal manipulation modules
* `/cli/` ‚Äì command-line interface logic
* `/docs/` ‚Äì documentation, specs, and theory
* `/sim/` ‚Äì simulation or logging tools
* etc.

Do not mix concerns across modules.

### 3. Sign the CLA

You **must** read and agree to the [CLA](./CLA.md) before submitting.

You agree to:

* Keep forks public
* Follow U.S. bioethical and U.S. ethical guidelines
* Allow oversight by the maintainer

### 4. Add Documentation

Each module or payload **must** include:

* A short Markdown doc in `/docs/` explaining purpose, inputs, ranges
* A simulated output screenshot or `.log` file (if applicable)

### 5. Make a Pull Request

Push your changes and open a PR.

* Include a summary of what you changed
* Reference any related issues
* Mention if this is an experimental or stable module

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Submit

* Audio files with active payloads
* Binary-only contributions
* Obfuscated, encrypted, or AI-generated blobs
* Anything you wouldn‚Äôt be able to explain in court

---

## üß™ Research-Only, Legally Safe

All modules must simulate or log ‚Äî no active deployment.
Payloads **must not** target real individuals, devices, or environments. AT ALL.

This is for research and analysis, not influence or deployment.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Government + Research Partners

If you‚Äôre from DARPA, CIA, MITRE, or similar:
We‚Äôre open to collaboration, but require full transparency, attribution, and code exposure.

**You fork it ‚Äî we watch it.**

## üßæ Final Notes

* Respect the mission: cognitive weaponization without compromise.
* We build for clarity, not comfort.
* We simulate to understand, not to harm.

Let‚Äôs redefine the boundaries of digital perception ‚Äî together.
