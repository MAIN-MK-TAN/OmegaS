WAVE TYPES, EFFECTS, AND POSSIBLE USES

----

WAVE TYPES:

Delta Waves (0.5–4Hz)
Theoretical Effects: Unconscious / Subconscious access
Possible use cases:
- Entertainment-prone mental passivity (~60–75%)
- Sleepiness (~85–95%)
- Possible (unlikely, target-dependent) artificial trust (~15–30%)
- Suggestion priming when combined with theta/alpha (~40%)

----

Theta Waves (4–8Hz)
Theoretical Effects: Relaxation, Creativity, Emotional Healing
Possible use cases:
- False comfort (~75%)
- Preparing a more 'dangerous' payload (~80%)
- Possible loss of focus (~65–85%)
- Increased suggestibility to language patterns (~60%)
- Light hypnagogic mimicry (~20–35%)

----

Alpha Waves (8–12Hz)
Theoretical Effects: Relaxation, Calm, Focus
Possible use cases:
- False calm (~70–80%)
- Cognitive confusion when paired with stress-inducing overlays (~90%+)
- False sense of safety (~50–75%)
- Subtle processing slowdown (~35–55%)

----

Beta Waves (12–30Hz)
Theoretical Effects: Alertness, Concentration, Stress
Possible use cases:
- Induced mental fatigue via prolonged over-alertness (~85%)
- Controlled focus loop injection (~65%)
- Combined with alpha/theta for perceptual desync (~75%)
- Synthetic ADHD mimicry (~55–70%)

----

Gamma Waves (30–100Hz)
Theoretical Effects: Higher mental activity, perception binding, memory
Possible use cases:
- Amplified mental strain when combined with load stimuli (~70–85%)
- False pattern recognition spikes (~55–65%)
- Memory distortions via overload + semantic flooding (~60%)
- Stress tolerance override threshold (~60%+ when primed)

----

Ultrasonic (>20,000Hz) & Subsonic (<20Hz)
Theoretical Effects: Non-conscious physical/cognitive resonance
Possible use cases:
- Subliminal priming via sub-perceptual vibration (~45%)
- Discomfort generation w/o identifiable source (~65–80%)
- Weaponization potential via directional control (~75%)
- Disruption of internal rhythm + mild nausea (<10Hz) (~55–70%)

----

Binaural Beats (custom multi-band delta)
Theoretical Effects: Hemispheric syncing, entrainment, cognitive opening
Possible use cases:
- Emotional instability amplification (~60–80%)
- Sleep cycle mimicry disruption (~50–70%)
- Gateway state layering into deeper entrainment fields (~60%)
- Entrapment in false “relaxation” loop (~80% for neurodivergent targets)

----

Synthetic / Modulated Pulse Clusters
Theoretical Effects: Pattern intrusion, semi-random disruption
Possible use cases:
- Perception lag injection (~65–75%)
- False relaxation then cognitive drop (~70%)
- Induced unidentifiable internal dissonance (~60%)
- Phase-drift cognitive instability (~40–55%, experimental)
