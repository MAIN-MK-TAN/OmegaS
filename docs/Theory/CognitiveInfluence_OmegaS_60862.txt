ABSTRACT:
This paper outlines a modular architecture for cognitive signal entrapment using psychoacoustic stimulus simulation. The project investigates non-lethal, ethically simulated audio payloads intended for modeling perception irregularities, stress thresholds, and frequency-induced response degradation in human-machine operators.

Unlike existing directed energy or neuromodulation platforms, MK-TAN_OmegaS prioritizes modular, software-only architecture capable of replicating signal-response conditions with zero deployment risk. No live testing has been conducted. All results are projected via simulation and theoretical frameworks.

OBJECTIVES:
- To define frequency regimes inducing mild-to-moderate discomfort in <30s exposure windows.
- To simulate operator cognitive deviation using structured amplitude, carrier wave, and interference design.
- To maintain U.S. bioethical compliance while simulating boundary-class research in perception modification.

METHODOLOGY:
- All payloads were defined using JSON-based schemas allowing programmable precision.
- Primary frequency ranges tested: 17Hz–7.5kHz, with known biological anchors at 18.98Hz, 111Hz, 528Hz, 741Hz.
- All exposures simulated through non-rendered function calls — no physical waveforms were produced.

DELIVERY TECHNIQUES SIMULATED:
- Binaural offset entrainment
- Amplitude-modulated attention pull
- Harmonic conflict triggering
- Subthreshold cognitive destabilizers
- Intermodulation pulses without predictable rhythmic baselines

RESULTS (SIMULATED):
- Simulated payloads with dual-frequency divergence (e.g., 341.3Hz vs 343Hz) showed higher modeled response interruption than standard mono-wave signals.
- No neural feedback loop tested (intentionally omitted).
- Logging modules record exposure time, theoretical neural fatigue delta (TNFD), and cognitive disruption index (CDI) using internal entropy variance models.

LIMITATIONS:
- No EEG, fMRI, or real-time biometric sampling.
- No auditory delivery mechanism was activated.
- Results are purely theoretical and rely on known psychoacoustic and neurological correlation ranges.

Glossary:
- TNFD: Theoretical Neural Fatigue Delta
- CDI: Cognitive Disruption Index
- Simulated Exposure: Payload function invoked without audio rendering
- Subthreshold: Below conscious auditory perception

THREAT SURFACE DISCUSSION:
Given the entirely simulated environment, threat modeling was conducted as a thought experiment:
- Offensive vector: Non-lethal disorientation of high-performance operator in cockpit/simulation environments.
- Defensive vector: Cognitive hardening against involuntary entrainment or subconscious biasing via sound.

LEGAL + ETHICAL POSITION:
All work follows United States research ethics frameworks and zero-human testing protocols.
No payloads were rendered, emitted, or injected into any bio-interfacing system.
This research exists to **define**, not deploy.

CONCLUSION:
MK-TAN_OmegaS demonstrates the feasibility of modeling synthetic cognitive edge vectors using modular psychoacoustic architecture. While deployment is legally and ethically forbidden, simulation allows the controlled exploration of boundary-class signal research.
